				<strong>Use of Cookies:</strong><br>
				To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Portal for our Users, we use "cookies", or such similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the User's individual interests using the identified computer. Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through registration), Chill&Pill has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User's hard drive. Chill&Pill's advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User's browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that Chill&Pill does not control.
				<br>
				Chill&Pill's web servers automatically collect limited information about User's computer's connection to the Internet, including User's IP address, when the User visits the Portal. (User's IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User - such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the User personally. Chill&Pill uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor its Portal to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within the Portal and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where Chill&Pill's visitors come.

				a. Chill&Pill also includes links to other websites. Such websites are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond Chill&Pill's control.

That policy may differ from Chill&Pill's own. If the User can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, the User may contact the site directly for more information. Chill&Pill is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

				<br>
